This repository contains implementation of algorithms of qubit mapping.


We are implementing the algorithms based on the research paper **A dynamic look-ahead heuristic for the qubit mapping problem of NISQ computers**.

To run the code :
Install qiskit and its environment using the IBM documentation :https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/install-qiskit
also make sure you have python intsalled on your computer.
run the  python files.

gd: This file contains the code for interaction graph from the quantum circuit and obtaining centers of interaction and coupling graphs.
im: This file implements the initial mapping algorithm (expansion from center).
