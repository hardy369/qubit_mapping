## **How the Code Works**

### **1. Interaction Graph (Gd):**
The interaction graph represents the logical connections between qubits in the quantum circuit.
- The quantum circuit is first converted into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- From the DAG, an interaction graph is constructed where:
  - **Nodes** represent logical qubits.
  - **Edges** represent interactions between qubits, weighted by the gate order in the circuit.

### **2. Coupling Graph (Gc):**
The coupling graph represents the physical constraints of a quantum computer's qubits.
- **Nodes** represent physical qubits.
- **Edges** represent possible connections between physical qubits.

### **3. Mapping Algorithm:**
The mapping algorithm ensures an optimal assignment of logical qubits to physical qubits, considering the constraints of the coupling graph.

#### Steps:
1. Identify the **center** of the interaction graph (interaction_center) and map it to the **center** of the coupling graph (coupling_center).
2. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of the interaction graph to determine the order of mapping.
3. Select candidate physical qubits for mapping based on:
   - **Proximity** to already mapped qubits.
   - **Degree** (number of neighbors) of the candidate physical qubit, used as a tie-breaker.

### **4. Output:**
The output of the algorithm is a mapping (Ï€) that assigns logical qubits to physical qubits efficiently.
